# Bridge Crossing 
In this problem, a family needs to cross a river at night by walking on a log that connects the two riverbanks. The log can only hold a maximum of two people at a time. Additionally, the family has only one flashlight, which must be carried by one of the individuals walking on the log each time.

Each family member takes a different amount of time to cross the river while walking on the log. This time is constant in both directions for each family member. For example, every time the grandmother crosses, it takes her the same amount of time, but the grandfather may take a different (yet constant) amount of time.

When two family members cross the river together, the crossing time is determined by the slower family member. The time it takes for each family member to cross the river is known in advance.

In summary, the problem involves the family members taking turns to cross the river on the log, with the constraint that only two people can be on the log at a time, and the time for each crossing is determined by the slower individual.
